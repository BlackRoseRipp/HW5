## Design

- What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

For our project, we utilized a singleton pattern for better compartmentalization in both our bot’s system as well as our team’s development process. Thinking of design methods allowed us to better plan our bot’s system and our approach to its development.

- What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

The only issue I encountered was when a section of our bot being developed by a team member hit issues and bugs that delayed its completion, which made proper testing of other sections nearly impossible due to a dependency on that particular section.

- What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

In the future, utilizing a builder pattern early on may alleviate some of the stresses caused by delays in other sections. However, the main practice I would utilize in the future would be giving the team more time for development to prevent the impact these delays had on development.
## Implementation

- What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

For our bot, we used Discord as the platform for our bot to interact with users. Discord has very useful and intuitive ways for bot integration into its system as well as makes user interaction extremely easy to manage with its built-in functionality.

- What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

Integrating different API’s into our bot to handle currency exchange rates as well as the timezone conversion algorithm was the most difficult. Regarding the currencies, the main issue was that we were limited to a certain number of calls to the API which made testing difficult. The time conversion algorithm was particularly difficult due to the complexity of converting the time differences between timezones. I would look into a currency API with more calls available as well as look into timezone conversion API’s to handle the complex calculations.

- What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would continue to use Discord as a platform to implement a bot since its system is extremely bot friendly and has the smallest learning curve. Their bot functionality also allows for features that I doubted that we would be able to implement into our bot.
## Process

- What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

Kanban was extremely useful in seeing the progress our team was making as well as giving us a sense of accomplishment when tasks were moved along the board. Additionally, code review was helpful in two ways: it prevented broken code from being added and merged to our main repository and it allowed for teammates to provide helpful feedback to code that could have been implemented differently.

- What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

At times, code review provided some frustrations but not for any negative reasons. These frustrations mostly came from teammates pointing out points in my code that would make it neater, easier to understand, or function better and I would kick myself for not seeing that solution as well beforehand. This is what made code review also invaluable.

- What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I think kanban as well as code review are essential in this kind of development environment where the team is working separately on big sections of the project. I would absolutely utilize these practices in future projects as well as jobs if they do not already.
